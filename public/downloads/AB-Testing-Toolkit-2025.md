## Hypothesis Framework

### The If-Then-Because Format

**Template:**
```
If [specific change],
then [expected outcome with metric],
because [reasoning based on user psychology/data].
```

**Examples by Test Type:**

#### Landing Page Tests
```
If we change the headline from "Best Marketing Software" to "Increase Your Leads by 40% in 30 Days",
then conversion rate will increase by 25%,
because specific, benefit-focused headlines with numbers create stronger motivation and clearer value propositions.
```

#### Form Optimization
```
If we reduce the contact form from 8 fields to 4 fields,
then form completion rate will increase by 35%,
because fewer fields reduce friction and perceived effort, leading to higher completion rates.
```

#### E-commerce Tests
```
If we add customer reviews below the product description,
then product page conversion rate will increase by 20%,
because social proof from other customers increases trust and reduces purchase anxiety.
```

#### CTA Button Tests
```
If we change the CTA button from "Submit" to "Get My Free Quote",
then button click rate will increase by 30%,
because specific, value-focused CTAs clearly communicate what users receive and reduce perceived risk.
```

### Hypothesis Quality Checklist
- [ ] Specific change is clearly defined
- [ ] Expected outcome includes measurable metric
- [ ] Reasoning is based on user psychology or data
- [ ] Hypothesis is testable with current traffic
- [ ] Success criteria are achievable
- [ ] Test aligns with business objectives

## Sample Size Calculator

### Formula & Implementation

```javascript
// Sample Size Calculation
function calculateSampleSize(baselineRate, minimumDetectableEffect, confidenceLevel, statisticalPower) {
    // Convert percentages to decimals
    const p1 = baselineRate / 100;
    const effect = minimumDetectableEffect / 100;
    const p2 = p1 * (1 + effect);
    
    // Z-scores for different confidence levels
    const zScores = {
        90: 1.645,
        95: 1.96,
        99: 2.576
    };
    
    // Z-scores for different statistical power levels
    const powerScores = {
        80: 0.84,
        90: 1.28,
        95: 1.645
    };
    
    const zAlpha = zScores[confidenceLevel];
    const zBeta = powerScores[statisticalPower];
    
    // Calculate sample size per variation
    const numerator = Math.pow(zAlpha + zBeta, 2) * (p1 * (1 - p1) + p2 * (1 - p2));
    const denominator = Math.pow(p2 - p1, 2);
    
    return Math.ceil(numerator / denominator);
}

// Example calculation
const sampleSize = calculateSampleSize(
    2.5,  // 2.5% baseline conversion rate
    20,   // 20% minimum detectable effect
    95,   // 95% confidence level
    80    // 80% statistical power
);
// Result: 3,842 visitors per variation
```

### Quick Reference Table

**For 95% Confidence, 80% Power:**

| Baseline Rate | 10% Lift | 15% Lift | 20% Lift | 25% Lift |

## Statistical Significance Calculator

### Implementation

```javascript
function calculateSignificance(controlVisitors, controlConversions, variationVisitors, variationConversions) {
    // Calculate conversion rates
    const controlRate = controlConversions / controlVisitors;
    const variationRate = variationConversions / variationVisitors;
    
    // Calculate pooled probability
    const pooledProb = (controlConversions + variationConversions) / (controlVisitors + variationVisitors);
    
    // Calculate standard error
    const standardError = Math.sqrt(pooledProb * (1 - pooledProb) * (1/controlVisitors + 1/variationVisitors));
    
    // Calculate z-score
    const zScore = (variationRate - controlRate) / standardError;
    
    // Calculate p-value (two-tailed test)
    const pValue = 2 * (1 - normalCDF(Math.abs(zScore)));
    
    // Calculate confidence interval
    const marginOfError = 1.96 * Math.sqrt((controlRate * (1 - controlRate) / controlVisitors) + (variationRate * (1 - variationRate) / variationVisitors));
    const lowerBound = (variationRate - controlRate) - marginOfError;
    const upperBound = (variationRate - controlRate) + marginOfError;
    
    return {
        controlRate: (controlRate * 100).toFixed(2) + '%',
        variationRate: (variationRate * 100).toFixed(2) + '%',
        improvement: (((variationRate - controlRate) / controlRate) * 100).toFixed(2) + '%',
        pValue: pValue.toFixed(4),
        isSignificant: pValue < 0.05,
        confidenceInterval: `${(lowerBound * 100).toFixed(2)}% to ${(upperBound * 100).toFixed(2)}%`,
        zScore: zScore.toFixed(3)
    };
}

// Example calculation
const result = calculateSignificance(5000, 125, 5000, 150);
console.log(result);
// {
//   controlRate: "2.50%",
//   variationRate: "3.00%", 
//   improvement: "20.00%",
//   pValue: "0.0234",
//   isSignificant: true,
//   confidenceInterval: "0.12% to 0.88%",
//   zScore: "2.267"
// }
```

### Interpretation Guide

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Statistical Mistakes
❌ **Peeking at Results Early**
- Problem: Checking results before statistical significance
- Solution: Set predetermined sample size and timeline

❌ **Multiple Testing Without Correction**
- Problem: Testing many variations increases false positive risk
- Solution: Use Bonferroni correction or limit variation count

❌ **Ignoring External Factors**
- Problem: Not accounting for seasonality, campaigns, etc.
- Solution: Document and analyze external influences

### Implementation Errors
