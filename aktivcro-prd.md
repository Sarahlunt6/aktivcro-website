# AktivCRO Website - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### Project Overview
AktivCRO is a revolutionary conversion rate optimization service that transforms static websites into intelligent problem-solving platforms. This PRD outlines the development of a visually stunning, interactive website that showcases AktivCRO's dual value proposition: systematic conversion optimization through proven frameworks AND custom micro-experiences that deliver instant value to visitors.

### Key Objectives
- Create a "wow factor" website that demonstrates our capabilities through its own design
- Showcase the four foundation frameworks and micro-experience examples
- Enable direct purchase of services with integrated payment processing
- Capture leads at multiple touchpoints for marketing automation
- Demonstrate ROI and value through interactive elements

### Success Metrics
- 5-10% conversion rate on service inquiries
- 80%+ engagement with interactive demos
- <3 second page load times
- 90%+ mobile responsiveness score

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Recommended Stack

#### Framework: Astro
**Justification:**
- **Performance**: Ships zero JavaScript by default, perfect for showcasing fast-loading sites
- **Component Islands**: Allows interactive React/Vue components only where needed
- **SEO Optimized**: Static generation with dynamic capabilities
- **Modern Developer Experience**: TypeScript support, component-based architecture
- **Build Output**: Can deploy anywhere (static hosting, edge functions, SSR)

#### Hosting: Cloudflare Pages + Workers
**Justification:**
- **Global CDN**: 200+ edge locations for ultra-fast loading
- **Integrated Workers**: For API routes, payment processing, lead capture
- **R2 Storage**: For demo assets, client examples
- **D1 Database**: If needed for dynamic content
- **Analytics Built-in**: Real user metrics without external scripts
- **Cost Effective**: Generous free tier, predictable pricing

**Alternative Analysis:**
- **Vercel**: Excellent DX, but more expensive at scale
- **ScalaHosting**: Good for WordPress, overkill for static sites
- **Recommendation**: Cloudflare for production, Vercel for staging/preview

#### Payment Processing: Stripe Direct Integration
**Justification:**
- **Checkout Components**: Pre-built, conversion-optimized UI
- **Webhook Integration**: Sync with GoHighLevel CRM
- **Subscription Support**: For recurring platform fees
- **PCI Compliance**: Handled by Stripe
- **Custom Pricing**: Support for tiered service packages

#### Database: Cloudflare D1 + R2
**Justification:**
- **D1**: For lead data, form submissions, analytics
- **R2**: For storing demo videos, case studies, assets
- **Edge Computing**: Data close to users
- **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with Workers
